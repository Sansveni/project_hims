				<h1> Household Inventory Management System</h1>
				<h2>Website designed by Charlie Didear</h2>
					<p>
					<b>Disclaimer:</b> This is a class project.  As such, this system does not have the complete functionality that
					I envision.  You can view items in the master catalogue, which is its own table in a MySQL database.
					Also, you can create a user account and login.  Username and password are stored in another table in the same 
					database.  Once you log in, you can also add and remove items from the master catalogue (table).
					<p>
					<b>Update:</b>  The login screen has been updated.  All links there work now.  In fact, the navigation system
					has been reorganized: now you have to login in order to add or remove items.  If you are not logged in, you can
					only view the contents of the database or do a search.  Also added a favicon (icon that displays in the tab 
					of a browser).
					</p>
					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>
					Ever buy a loaf of bread when you already had plenty at home, 
					or come return from a shopping trip only to learn you forgot to buy butter?  The 
					Household Inventory Management System (project name; market name TBA) is designed
					to allow individuals and families to easily keep track of the common household items in their home.
